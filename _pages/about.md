Hi, I'm Kelsi. I'm a lifelong learner and educator who is passionate about accessibility and equity. I create accessible resources for non-speaking students and explore interests in educational policy and funding through projects and self-study. Outside of the classroom, I co-founded a local non-profit, Lehigh Valley Girls Rock, that has continued to grow since 2013. Our goal was to empower young girls, trans and non-binary folks to express themselves through art and music, and it's success can be seen through all of the youth that have returned each year for camp and the bands and relationships that have formed from the programming.
