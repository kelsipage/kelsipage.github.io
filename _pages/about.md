Hi, I'm Kelsi. I'm a lifelong learner and educator who is passionate about educational accessibility and equity. I create accessible resources for non-speaking students and explore interests in educational policy through projects and self-study. Outside of the classroom, I co-founded a local youth empowerment non-profit, Lehigh Valley Girls Rock, that has continued to grow since 2013.
